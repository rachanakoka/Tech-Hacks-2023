            Thing nouns are like the treasures we find in our daily lives. <br> <br> 
            From "toys" and "books" to "snacks" and "beds," these words give names to the objects we interact with every day. Thing nouns make our world rich and interesting.<br> <br> 
            
            5. Animal Nouns - Our Furry and Feathery Friends: <br>
