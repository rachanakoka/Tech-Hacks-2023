            Welcome to our super fun numbers lesson!<br> Today, we're going to explore the amazing world of numbers. Numbers are everywhere,<br>
             and we use them to count, measure, and have lots of fun!<br><br>

            What Are Numbers?<br>
            Numbers are like magic words that help us talk about how many things we have or see. We can use numbers to count toys, friends, or even our favorite snacks!<br><br>
            
            Meet the Numbers<br>
            Let's say hello to some special numbers:<br><br>
            
            One: The lonely number one is like a single star in the sky. Can you think of one special thing you love?<br><br>
            
            Two: Two is like having a pair of shoes or two yummy cookies. Double the fun!<br><br>
            
            Three: Three is like a tricycle with three wheels or three colorful balloons in the sky.<br><br>
            
            Counting Fun<br>
            Now, let's practice counting! 🎉<br><br>
            
            1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!<br><br>
            
            Great job! You are a fantastic counter!<br><br>
            
            Counting with Friends<br>
            Count with your friends, toys, or even your pet. How many friends do you have? Count them and see!<br><br>
            
            Let's Play a Game!<br>
            Are you ready for a game? 🎲 Let's roll a dice! The dice has numbers, and we can count the dots on it. Roll the dice and tell me what number you see!<br><br>

            Number Art<br>
            Grab your crayons and draw your favorite number! You can draw one big sun for number one or three colorful balloons for number three.<br><br>
            
            Homework Challenge<br>
            Your homework challenge is to find numbers around your house. Look for numbers on your toys, books, or even the clock! Can you write down the numbers you find?<br><br></p>
